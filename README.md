## [Project 1; Gresikafe Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/akmalrizk/gresikafe_sales_project)

This is my first project when I begin my Data Analytics adventure by analysing sales from a coffee shop. This project analyses Gresikafe sales transaction data using Google BigQuery and visualises insights in Looker Studio. The goal is to uncover sales trends, best-selling products, and revenue patterns to support data-driven business decisions.

- I mainly used SQL (Big Query) and Looker Studio.
- Dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training): ***Cafe Sales - Dirty Data for Cleaning Training*** by ***Ahmed Mohamed***
- Dataset has been cleaned before doing the analysis with SQL (Big Query).
- Dataset also has been visualised using Google Looker Studio.
